### Why to use Amazon S3?
By using  Amazon S3 we can easily create buckets, storing data and download data with permissions.

### How to start using Amazon S3?
##### Step 1:
Abb this command to commandLine: `amplify add storage`;
Then Enter the following:
```
? Please select from one of the below mentioned services:
    `Content (Images, audio, video, etc.)`
? You need to add auth (Amazon Cognito) to your project in order to add storage for user files. Do you want to add auth now?
    `Yes`
? Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration?
    `Default configuration`
? How do you want users to be able to sign in?
    `Username`
? Do you want to configure advanced settings?
    `No, I am done.`
? Please provide a friendly name for your resource that will be used to label this category in the project:
    `S3friendlyName`
? Please provide bucket name:
    `storagebucketname`
? Who should have access:
    `Auth and guest users`
? What kind of access do you want for Authenticated users?
    `create/update, read, delete`
? What kind of access do you want for Guest users?
    `create/update, read, delete`
? Do you want to add a Lambda Trigger for your S3 Bucket?
    `No`
```
##### Step 2:
Push the changes to amplify: `amplify push`

##### Step 3:
Add the dependencies:
```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-storage-s3:1.17.4'
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-auth-cognito:1.17.4'
}
``` 

##### Step 4:
Initialize Amplify Storage
```
Amplify.addPlugin(new AWSCognitoAuthPlugin());
Amplify.addPlugin(new AWSS3StoragePlugin());
```
Then the class should  look like this:
```
public class MyAmplifyApp extends Application {
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();

        try {
            // Add these lines to add the AWSCognitoAuthPlugin and AWSS3StoragePlugin plugins
            Amplify.addPlugin(new AWSCognitoAuthPlugin());
            Amplify.addPlugin(new AWSS3StoragePlugin());
            Amplify.configure(getApplicationContext());

            Log.i("MyAmplifyApp", "Initialized Amplify");
        } catch (AmplifyException error) {
            Log.e("MyAmplifyApp", "Could not initialize Amplify", error);
        }
    }
}
```

##### Step 5:
Upload data to your bucket
```
private void uploadFile() {
    File exampleFile = new File(getApplicationContext().getFilesDir(), "ExampleKey");

    try {
        BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(exampleFile));
        writer.append("Example file contents");
        writer.close();
    } catch (Exception exception) {
        Log.e("MyAmplifyApp", "Upload failed", exception);
    }

    Amplify.Storage.uploadFile(
            "ExampleKey",
            exampleFile,
            result -> Log.i("MyAmplifyApp", "Successfully uploaded: " + result.getKey()),
            storageFailure -> Log.e("MyAmplifyApp", "Upload failed", storageFailure)
    );
}
```
