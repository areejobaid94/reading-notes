# Maps, primitives, File I/O

### Java Primitives versus Objects

#### 1. Java Type System

Java has a two-fold type system consisting of primitives such as int, boolean and reference types such as Integer, Boolean. Every primitive type corresponds to a reference type.

Objects => reference type in Java are slower and have a bigger memory impact than their primitive analogs.

### Exceptions

##### The Java programming language uses exceptions to handle errors and other exceptional event

#### How to Throw Exceptions
Throwing an exception is as simple as using the "throw" statement.

#### Example:
```
public static void main(String[] args) {
	Scanner kb = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.println("Enter a number");
    try {
    	double nb1 = kb.nextDouble();
    	if(nb1<0)
        	throw new ArithmeticException();
        else System.out.println( "result : " + Math.sqrt(nb1) );
    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
        System.out.println("You tried an impossible sqrt");
    }
}
}
```

#### The Three Kinds of Exceptions

1. checked exception.
2. error.
3. runtime exception.

##### A program can catch exceptions by using a combination of the try, catch, and finally blocks.

* try => code in which an exception can occur.
* catch => handle a particular type of exception.
* finally => do the final thing.

#### The try statement should contain at least one catch block or a finally block and may have multiple catch blocks.

### Scanning

![](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis1xx/resources/java/fileIO/io-ins.gif)

Objects of type Scanner are useful for breaking down formatted input into tokens and translating individual tokens according to their data type.

Example:

```
import java.io.*;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ScanXan {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {

        Scanner s = null;

        try {
            s = new Scanner(new BufferedReader(new FileReader("xanadu.txt")));

            while (s.hasNext()) {
                System.out.println(s.next());
            }
        } finally {
            if (s != null) {
                s.close();
            }
        }
    }
}
```
