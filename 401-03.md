### Java Primitives versus Objects

#### 1. Java Type System

Java has a two-fold type system consisting of primitives such as int, boolean and reference types such as Integer, Boolean. Every primitive type corresponds to a reference type.
The wrapper classes are immutable (so that their state can't change once the object is constructed) and are final (so that we can't inherit from them).

Objects in Java are slower and have a bigger memory impact than their primitive analogs.

### Exceptions

##### The Java programming language uses exceptions to handle errors and other exceptional event

##### Note => The Catch or Specify Requirement

#### How to Throw Exceptions

```
public Object pop() {
    Object obj;

    if (size == 0) {
        throw new EmptyStackException();
    }

    obj = objectAt(size - 1);
    setObjectAt(size - 1, null);
    size--;
    return obj;
}
```

#### The Three Kinds of Exceptions

1. checked exception.
2. error.
3. runtime exception.

##### A program can catch exceptions by using a combination of the try, catch, and finally blocks.

1. The try block identifies a block of code in which an exception can occur.
2. The catch block identifies a block of code, known as an exception handler, that can handle a particular type of exception.
3. The finally block identifies a block of code that is guaranteed to execute, and is the right place to close files, recover resources, and otherwise clean up after the code enclosed in the try block.

#### The try statement should contain at least one catch block or a finally block and may have multiple catch blocks.

### Scanning

Objects of type Scanner are useful for breaking down formatted input into tokens and translating individual tokens according to their data type.

Example:

```
import java.io.*;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ScanXan {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {

        Scanner s = null;

        try {
            s = new Scanner(new BufferedReader(new FileReader("xanadu.txt")));

            while (s.hasNext()) {
                System.out.println(s.next());
            }
        } finally {
            if (s != null) {
                s.close();
            }
        }
    }
}
```
