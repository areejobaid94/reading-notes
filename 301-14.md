# Database Normalization

![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/O2smv.png)

Normalization is a technique for organizing data in a database. It is important that a database is normalized to minimize redundancy (duplicate data) and to ensure only related data is stored in each table. It also prevents any issues stemming from database modifications such as insertions, deletions, and updates.

### First Normal Form (1NF):
1- Data is stored in tables with rows uniquely identified by a primary key
2- Data within each table is stored in individual columns in its most reduced form
3- There are no repeating groups

### Second Normal Form (2NF):
1- Everything from 1NF
2- Only data that relates to a tableâ€™s primary key is stored in each table

### Third Normal Form (3NF):
1- Everything from 2NF
2- There are no in-table dependencies between the columns in each table
