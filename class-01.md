## How People Access the Web:

#### The different ways in which people access the web and clarify some terminology are:

| Browsers                                                                                     | Web Servers                                                                                                                                          | Screen readers                                                                                                         |

| A web browser Popular examples include Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari,Chrome, and Opera. | Web servers are special computers that are constantly connected to the Internet, and are optimized to send web pages out to people who request them. | Screen readers are programs that read out the ontents of a computer screen to a user. They are commonly used by people |
| with visual impairments.                                                                     |

## How the Web Works:

#### Web pages are written in text with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), then uploaded to a host computer running web server software, such as Apache or Microsoft’s IIS (Internet Information Server).

#### The web server sends out pages when they are requested by a web browser, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. The host and client communicate using an agreed ’language’ called HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol). This is why web page addresses begin with http:// and so on.

## How Pages Use Structure:

### HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages.

## The Evolution of HTML:

1. HTML 4.

2. XHTML 1.0.

3. HTML5.

## DOCTYPEs:

### DOCTYPEs is an instruction that associates a particular XML or SGML document (for example, a webpage) with a document type definition (DTD) (for example, the formal definition of a particular version of HTML 2.0 - 4.0).

## Comments in HTML:

### If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser.

### Example:

```
   <!-- -->
```

## ID Attribute:

### The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document. The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet.

## Class Attribute:

### The class attribute specifies one or more classnames for an element. The class attribute is mostly used to point to a class in a style sheet. However, it can also be used by a JavaScript (via the HTML DOM) to make changes to HTML elements with a specified class.

## Block Elements:

### A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

## Inline Elements:

### An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary.

### This is a `<span>` element inside a paragraph.

## Traditional HTML Layouts:

### For a long time, web page authors used `<div>` elements to group together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a header, an article, footer or sidebar).

## Site Maps:

### A site map (or sitemap) is a list of pages of a web site within a domain. There are three primary kinds of site map: Site maps used during the planning of a Web site by its designers. Human-visible listings, typically hierarchical, of the pages on a site.

## JS:

### Some scripts are simple and only deal with one individual scenario, like a simple recipe for a basic dish. Other scripts can perform many tasks, like a recipe for a complicated three-course meal.

### Another similarity is that, if you are new to cooking or programming, there is a lot of new terminology to learn.
