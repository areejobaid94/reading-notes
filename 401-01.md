## ELI5: What does it mean to compile code?

As you may know, everything in a computer is represented by a series of 1's and 0's (which themselves represent high and low voltages on transistors, but that's a topic for another time). When the computer runs a program, the program itself is made of a bunch of 1's and 0's.

However, since we still need humans to write our programs, putting everything in 1's and 0's (called machine language) would be very difficult. So we made higher level languages like Java and C# to write code in. These languages look a lot more like English, so they're a lot easier to write and maintain.

When you compile code, the compilor (usually another program) takes the program the human wrote, and converts it into the program the computer can understand (i.e. converts from Java to machine language). The very short version could be, yes, compile means to make the code executable.

Something you may run into is people saying code does or does not compile. This means the compilor they used checks to make sure their program is written correctly according to the rules of the programming language. For example, most programming languages make you put a semicolon (;) at the end of every line. A very common mistake is to forget that semicolon, so when you try and compile the compilor gives you an error.
