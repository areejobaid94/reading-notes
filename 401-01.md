## ELI5: What does it mean to compile code?

Compiling is the transformation from Source Code (human readable) into machine code (computer executable). A compiler is a program. A compiler takes the recipe (code) for a new program (written in a high level language) and transforms this Code into a new language (Machine Language) that can be understood by the computer itself. This "machine language" is difficult to impossible for humans to read and understand (much less debug and maintain), thus the need for "high level languages" such as JAVA.

Something you may run into is people saying code does or does not compile. This means the compilor they used checks to make sure their program is written correctly according to the rules of the programming language. For example, most programming languages make you put a semicolon (;) at the end of every line. A very common mistake is to forget that semicolon, so when you try and compile the compilor gives you an error.
