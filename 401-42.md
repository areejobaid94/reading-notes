### Google Backtracks, Says Its AI Will Not Be Used for Weapons or Surveillance
This article is talking about Google using AI in Weapons or Surveillance.
I'm not agree with using AI from Google in Weapons or Surveillance, and after reading this article and knowing that Google using the AI in Weapons or Surveillance,
I really think that Google must stop doing that or give more explanation and to offer more public transparency as to the systems they build.
The artical was good and the way of giving the informations is really good and I hope that Google can focus more on using the AL in solving real problems rather than Weapons or Surveillance.
And at the end I really appreciate the conscientious employees willing to risk their positions in Google to ensure the company â€˜does no evil.

### Will Democracy Survive Big Data and Artificial Intelligence?
Very soon we will have smart homes, smart factories and smart cities, it can be expected that supercomputers will soon surpass human capabilities.
Is this thing is good in general? big data will make the life easier but also it will affect our decisions, such controllers govern our daily lives.
I agree with using the AI to make huoman life easier but on the auther hand it will affect our life in negative way it will decrease our
freedom in the digital era.
We need to put limit and roles for using the AL and big data to avoid the danger of using them.
