## Responsive Web Design and Regular Expressions
### What is a Grid-View?

#### A responsive grid-view often has 12 columns, and has a total width of 100%, and will shrink and expand as you resize the browser window.

First we must calculate the percentage for one column: 100% / 12 columns = 8.33%.

Then we make one class for each of the 12 columns, class="col-" and a number defining how many columns the section should span:

## Regex tutorial — A quick cheatsheet by examples

### Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are extremely useful in extracting information from any text by searching for one or more matches of a specific search pattern (i.e. a specific sequence of ASCII or unicode characters).

### Basic topics

##### Anchors — ^ and $

```
^The        matches any string that starts with The -> Try it!
end$        matches a string that ends with end
^The end$   exact string match (starts and ends with The end)
roar        matches any string that has the text roar in it
```

##### Quantifiers — * + ? and {}

```
abc*        matches a string that has ab followed by zero or more c -> Try it!
abc+        matches a string that has ab followed by one or more c
abc?        matches a string that has ab followed by zero or one c
abc{2}      matches a string that has ab followed by 2 c
abc{2,}     matches a string that has ab followed by 2 or more c
abc{2,5}    matches a string that has ab followed by 2 up to 5 c
a(bc)*      matches a string that has a followed by zero or more copies of the sequence bc
a(bc){2,5}  matches a string that has a followed by 2 up to 5 copies of the sequence bc
```

##### OR operator — | or []

```
a(b|c)     matches a string that has a followed by b or c (and captures b or c) -> Try it!
a[bc]      same as previous, but without capturing b or c
```

##### Character classes — \d \w \s and .

```
\d         matches a single character that is a digit -> Try it!
\w         matches a word character (alphanumeric character plus underscore) -> Try it!
\s         matches a whitespace character (includes tabs and line breaks)
.          matches any character -> Try it!
```
