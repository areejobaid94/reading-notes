# Application Fundamentals
You can write your Android app code using Kotlin, Java, and C++ languages and then Android SDK tools compile your code along with any data and resource files into an APK.

### Android security features:

- Multi-user Linux system => each app is a different user. 
- Unique Linux user ID for each app.
- Each process has its own virtual machine.

Each app in Android system has only access to the components that it requires to do its work and there are a ways for sharing the data between the app and the other apps like:

- Share the same Linux user ID 
- Request permission to access device data such as the Camera.

### App components

* Activity: It is the the UI of the Android App.
* Services: We use the services to add logic to our apps.
* Broadcast receivers: using to deliver events to the app outside of a regular user flow. 
* Content providers: Manages a shared set of app data that you can store in the file system.

### Activating components
Intent is an object use to bind individual components to each other at runtime.

##### Methods for activating components:

- When you want the activity to return a result you can pass Intent to startActivity() or startActivityForResult().

- When you want to give new instructions to an ongoing service, you can pass passing an Intent to startService().

- When you want to initiate a broadcast, you can by passing an Intent to methods such as sendBroadcast().
