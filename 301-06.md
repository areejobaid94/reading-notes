# Node.js

## What Is Node.js?
Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

* Node.js is an open source server environment
* Node.js is free
* Node.js runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.)
* Node.js uses JavaScript on the server

#### Node Is Built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine

## How Do I Install Node.js?
`npm i node.js`
Once you have downloaded and installed Node.js on your computer, let's try to display "Hello World" in a web browser.

### Getting Started
```
var http = require('http');

http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
  res.end('Hello World!');
}).listen(8080);
```

#### Include Modules
```
var http = require('http');
```
Now your application has access to the HTTP module, and is able to create a server:
```
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
  res.end('Hello World!');
}).listen(8080);
```

### Installing a Package Locally
```
npm init -y
```

JavaScript is everywhere, and Node is a vast and expansive subject. Nonetheless, I hope that in this article I’ve offered you the beginner-friendly, high-level look at Node.js and its main paradigms that I promised at the beginning. I also hope that when you re-read the definitions we looked at previously, things will make a lot more sense.
