# Spring RESTful Routing & Static Files

### Spring RequestMapping:

1. @RequestMapping — by Path
   `@RequestMapping(value = "/ex/foos", method = RequestMethod.GET)`

2. @RequestMapping — the HTTP Method
   The HTTP method parameter has no default.
   `@RequestMapping(value = "/ex/foos", method = POST)`

- RequestMapping and HTTP Headers

1. @RequestMapping With the headers Attribute
   `@RequestMapping(value = "/ex/foos", headers = "key=val", method = GET)`

2. @RequestMapping Consumes and Produces
   Mapping media types produced by a controller method is worth special attention.

- RequestMapping With Path Variables

1. Single @PathVariable
2. Multiple @PathVariable
3. PathVariable With Regex
