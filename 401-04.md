# OOP

### Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

#### What Is an Object?

It's an instance of the class,a software bundle of related state and behaviour. Software objects are often used to model the real-world objects that you find in everyday life.

Bundling code into individual software objects provides a number of benefits, including:

1. Modularity: The source code for an object can be written and maintained independently of the source code for other objects. Once created, an object can be easily passed around inside the system.
2. Information-hiding: By interacting only with an object's methods, the details of its internal implementation remain hidden from the outside world.
3. Code re-use: If an object already exists (perhaps written by another software developer), you can use that object in your program. This allows specialists to implement/test/debug complex, task-specific objects, which you can then trust to run in your own code.
4. Pluggability and debugging ease: If a particular object turns out to be problematic, you can simply remove it from your application and plug in a different object as its replacement. This is analogous to fixing mechanical problems in the real world. If a bolt breaks, you replace it, not the entire machine.

#### What Is a Class?

A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.

```
class Bicycle {

    int cadence = 0;
    int speed = 0;
    int gear = 1;

    void changeCadence(int newValue) {
         cadence = newValue;
    }

    void changeGear(int newValue) {
         gear = newValue;
    }

    void speedUp(int increment) {
         speed = speed + increment;
    }

    void applyBrakes(int decrement) {
         speed = speed - decrement;
    }

    void printStates() {
         System.out.println("cadence:" +
             cadence + " speed:" +
             speed + " gear:" + gear);
    }
}
```

#### What Is Inheritance?

Inheritance provides a powerful and natural mechanism for organizing and structuring your software.
Object-oriented programming allows classes to inherit commonly used state and behavior from other classes.

```
class MountainBike extends Bicycle {

    // new fields and methods defining
    // a mountain bike would go here

}
```

#### What Is an Interface?

An interface is a contract between a class and the outside world.

```
interface Bicycle {

    //  wheel revolutions per minute
    void changeCadence(int newValue);

    void changeGear(int newValue);

    void speedUp(int increment);

    void applyBrakes(int decrement);
}

class ACMEBicycle implements Bicycle {

    int cadence = 0;
    int speed = 0;
    int gear = 1;

   // The compiler will now require that methods
   // changeCadence, changeGear, speedUp, and applyBrakes
   // all be implemented. Compilation will fail if those
   // methods are missing from this class.

    void changeCadence(int newValue) {
         cadence = newValue;
    }

    void changeGear(int newValue) {
         gear = newValue;
    }

    void speedUp(int increment) {
         speed = speed + increment;
    }

    void applyBrakes(int decrement) {
         speed = speed - decrement;
    }

    void printStates() {
         System.out.println("cadence:" +
             cadence + " speed:" +
             speed + " gear:" + gear);
    }
}
```

#### What Is a Package?

A package is a namespace for organizing classes and interfaces in a logical manner.

### Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers:

1. Decimal:
   Every digit in a decimal number has a "position", and the decimal point helps us to know which position is which.
   The Decimal Number System is also called "Base 10", because it is based on the number 10, with these 10 symbols:

2. Binary Numbers:
   Binary Numbers are just "Base 2" instead of "Base 10". So you start counting at 0, then 1, then you run out of digits

3. Hexadecimal Numbers:
   They look the same as the decimal numbers up to 9, but then there are the letters ("A',"B","C","D","E","F") in place of the decimal numbers 10 to 15.
