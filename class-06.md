#### A JavaScript object literal is a comma-separated list of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces. 

#### Objects are variables . But objects can contain many values.

### Example
```
var myObject = {
    sProp: 'some string value',
    numProp: 2,
    bProp: false
};
```

#### The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).

#### JavaScript objects are containers for named values called properties or methods.

## DOM 

![](https://www.w3schools.com/js/pic_htmltree.gif)

#### When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.

#### The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree.

#### The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.

#### The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents:

#### "The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."

### The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:

* Core DOM - standard model for all document types

* XML DOM - standard model for XML documents 

* XML DOM - standard model for XML documents

### The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:

#### The HTML elements as objects,  The properties of all HTML elements, the methods to access all HTML elements.
#### The events for all HTML elements, in other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.
