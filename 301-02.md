### jQuery is a JavaScript Library.

jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.
The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.
jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.
jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.

### using jQuery:

you can use jQuery in you code by:
- Adding jQuery to Your Web Pages.

- Downloading jQuery.

- jQuery CDN:
If you don't want to download and host jQuery yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).
```
<head>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
</head>
```

### jQuery Selectors:

* The element Selector
```
$(element)
```

* The #id Selector
```
$(#id)
```

* The .class Selector
```

```

### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

![](https://stackify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Pair_Programming-793x411.png)

Two heads are better than one than stop reading over my shoulder, pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together.

#### Why pair program?

1. Greater efficiency:

When coming up with ideas and discussing solutions out loud, two programmers may come to a solution faster than one programmer on their own.

2. Engaged collaboration:

Aspect of learning to program is knowing when to ask for help.

3. Learning from fellow students:

Working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of. 

4. Social skills:

When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key. 

5. Job interview readiness:

Companies can get a better feel for how an applicant will fit into the team and their collaboration style.

6. Work environment readiness:

Code Fellows graduates who are already familiar with how pairing works can hit the ground running at a new job, with one less hurdle to overcome.
