# Graphs

A graph data structure is a collection of nodes that have data and are connected to other nodes.

### What is Vertex in Graph?
It is a node, which is an object with zero or more adjacent vertices.

### What is an Edge in Graph?
It is a connection between two nodes or vertex.

### What is an Neighbor in Graph?
They are the adjacent nodes of the node.

### What is an Degree in Graph?
It is a number of edges connected to that vertex or node.

### Directed "Digraph" vs Undirected 
Directed graphs is a graph where every edge is directed.
Undirected graphs is a graph where each edge is undirected.

### Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected

#### Complete Graphs:
A Complete graph is a simple undirected graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge.

#### Connected Graphs:
It is a graph in which each node has at least one edge.

#### Disconnected  Graphs:
It is a graph in which some node may not have edges.

### Acyclic vs Cyclic

#### Acyclic Graph:
An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles.

#### Cyclic Graph:
A Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles.

#### What is Weighted Graph?
It is a graph with graph numbers assigned to its edges.

By using a weight you can make calculation to find the better path, by calculation the total sum of the eges in each path.


### Traversals:
We can use either use `Breadth First` or `Depth First` in travelling in the gragh.
