# Flexbox and Templating:

#### Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code - anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.


## Where to use mustache.js?

#### You can use mustache.js to render mustache templates anywhere you can use JavaScript. This includes web browsers, server-side environments such as Node.js, and CouchDB views.

It is often referred to as “logic-less” because there are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops. Instead, there are only tags. Some tags are replaced with a value, some nothing, and others a series of values.

### Example:
```
Mustache.render(“Hello, {{name}}”, { name: “Sherlynn” });
// returns: Hello, Sherlynn
```

* flex-direction
* flex-wrap
* flex-flow

* align-content

##### The flex-direction Property:
The `flex-direction` property defines in which direction the container wants to stack the flex items.

##### The flex-wrap Property:
The `flex-wrap` property specifies whether the flex items should wrap or not.
The examples below have 12 flex items, to better demonstrate the flex-wrap property.

##### The flex-flow Property
The `flex-flow property` is a shorthand property for setting both the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties.

##### The justify-content Property
The `justify-content` property is used to align the flex items:

##### The align-items Property
The `align-items` property is used to align the flex items.

##### The align-content Property
The `align-content` property is used to align the flex lines.
