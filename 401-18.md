### What is Websocket?

WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.

This is the main reasion which websocket is preferred over the HTTP protocol when building a chat-like communication service that operates at high frequencies with low latency.

#### Configuring WebSocket

- `@EnableWebSocketMessageBroker` annotation is used to enable our WebSocket server.
- `WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer` interface is used to provide implementation for some of its methods to configure the websocket connection.
- `registerStompEndpoints` method is used to register a websocket endpoint that the clients will use to connect to the server.
- `configureMessageBroker` method is used to configure our message broker which will be used to route messages from one client to another.
