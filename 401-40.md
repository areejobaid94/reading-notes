# Location

### How to get the last known location?

1. Set up Google Play services
* Download and install the Google Play services component via the `SDK Manager`.
* Add the library to your project.

2. Specify app permissions by doing request location permissions.

3. Create location services client by adding in OnCreate.

### Example
```
@Override protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { 
fusedLocationClient = LocationServices.getFusedLocationProviderClient(this);  } ``` 4. Get the last known location    - When your app is connected to these you can use the fused location provider's `getLastLocation()` method to retrieve the device location.    ```
fusedLocationClient.getLastLocation()
    .addOnSuccessListener(this, new OnSuccessListener<Location>() {
        @Override
        public void onSuccess(Location location) {
            // Got last known location. In some rare situations this can be null.
            if (location != null) {
                // Logic to handle location object
            }
        }
    });    ``` 5. Maintain a current best estimate    - To validate the accuracy of a location that's returned from getLastLocation(), complete steps that include the following:

 - Check whether the location retrieved is significantly newer than the previously fetched location.
 - Check whether the accuracy claimed by the location is better or worse than that of the previous estimate.
 - Check the provider that's associated with the new location. Decide whether you trust this provider more than the one used in your app's cached location.
```
