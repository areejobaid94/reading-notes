# Spring Authentication

![](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/html5/images/servlet/saml2/saml2webssoauthenticationfilter.png)

### Authentication => who are you?
### Authorization or access control => what are you allowed to do?

#### AuthenticationManager is main interface for Authorization. 

```
public interface AuthenticationManager {

  Authentication authenticate(Authentication authentication)
    throws AuthenticationException;
}
```

##### An AuthenticationManager can do one of 3 things in its authenticate() method:
* Return an Authentication (normally with authenticated=true) if it can verify that the input represents a valid principal.

* Throw an AuthenticationException if it believes that the input represents an invalid principal.

* Return null if it cannot decide.

#### Authorization or Access Control:

There are three implementations provided by the framework and all three delegate to a chain of `AccessDecisionVoter` instances, a bit like the `ProviderManager` delegates to `AuthenticationProviders`.

#### Web Security:

#### Method Security:

As well as support for securing web applications, Spring Security offers support for applying access rules to Java method executions. For Spring Security, this is just a different type of “protected resource”. For users, it means the access rules are declared using the same format of ConfigAttribute strings (for example, roles or expressions) but in a different place in your code. The first step is to enable method security — for example, in the top level configuration for our application:

```
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(securedEnabled = true)
public class SampleSecureApplication {
}
```

#### Spring Auth Cheat Sheet

##### - Step 1: set up a user model and repo
##### - Step 2: create a controller for that model
##### - Step 3: UserDetailsServiceImpl implements UserDetailsService
##### - Step 4: ApplicationUser implements UserDetails
##### - Step 5: WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter
##### - Step 6: registration page
##### - Step 7: login page
