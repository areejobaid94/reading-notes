# Related Resources and Integration Testing 

### Working with Relationships in Spring Data REST

1. One-to-One Relationship:

In a one-to-one relationship, one record in a table is associated with one and only one record in another table. For example, in a school database, each student has only one student ID, and each student ID is assigned to only one person.

Exmple in spring:

```
@Entity
public class Library {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private long id;

    @Column
    private String name;

    @OneToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "address_id")
    @RestResource(path = "libraryAddress", rel="address")
    private Address address;
    
    // standard constructor, getters, setters
}

@Entity
public class Address {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private long id;

    @Column(nullable = false)
    private String location;

    @OneToOne(mappedBy = "address")
    private Library library;

    // standard constructor, getters, setters
}
```

2. One-to-Many Relationship

In systems analysis, a one-to-many relationship is a type of cardinality that refers to the relationship between two entities A and B in which an element of A may be linked to many elements of B, but a member of B is linked to only one element of A. For instance, think of A as books, and B as pages. 

Example in spring:
```
@Entity
public class Book {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private long id;
    
    @Column(nullable=false)
    private String title;
    
    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name="library_id")
    private Library library;
    
    // standard constructor, getter, setter
}

public class Library {
 
    //...
 
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "library")
    private List<Book> books;
 
    //...
 
}
```

3. Many-to-Many Relationship:

![](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/sql/images/ManyToMany.png)

```
@Entity
public class Author {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private long id;

    @Column(nullable = false)
    private String name;

    @ManyToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    @JoinTable(name = "book_author", 
      joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "book_id", referencedColumnName = "id"), 
      inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "author_id", 
      referencedColumnName = "id"))
    private List<Book> books;

    //standard constructors, getters, setters
}

public class Book {
 
    //...
 
    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "books")
    private List<Author> authors;
 
    //...
}
```

A many-to-many relationship occurs when multiple records in a table are associated with multiple records in another table. For example, a many-to-many relationship exists between customers and products: customers can purchase various products, and products can be purchased by many customers.

### Integration Testing in Spring

Integration testing plays an important role in the application development cycle by verifying the end-to-end behavior of a system.
