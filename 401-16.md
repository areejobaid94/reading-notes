# Spring Boot and OAuth2

### Sample app doing various things with "social login" using OAuth 2.0 and Spring Boot.

#### There are several samples building on each other, adding new features at each step:

- simple: a very basic static app with just a home page and unconditional login via Spring Boot’s OAuth 2.0 configuration properties (if you visit the home page, you will be automatically redirected to GitHub).

- click: adds an explicit link that the user has to click to login.

- logout: adds a logout link as well for authenticated users.

- two-providers: adds a second login provider so the user can choose on the home page which one to use.

- custom-error: adds an error message for unauthenticated users, and a custom authentication based on GitHub’s API.
